COMMANDS

                                                                     *:Godoc*
:Godoc |package-spec| [symbol[.method]]

Display Go package documentation. 

The package is specified by one of the following:

  - If the specification is the path of a Go source file, then use the package
    containing the source file. The |cmdline-special| characters '%' and '#'
    are useful for specifying a source file.

  - If the specification starts with "/", then use the remainder of the
    specification as an import path.

  - The specification is taken as the name of a package imported in the
    current file.

The keyboard mappings for a documentation buffer are:

  <CR>    Jump to underlined entity.
  ]]      Jump to next declaration
  [[      Jump to previous declaration
  g?      Show this help.

                                                                     *:Godef*
:Godef |package-spec| [symbol[.method]]

GoDef is like |:GoDoc|, except it jumps to the code instead of showing the
documentation.
